=============

Contributions are welcome and greatly appreciated.

Install
-------

To build and install the package, run::

  python setup.py build_ext --inplace
  python setup.py install

Testing
-------
To run unit tests, run::

  pytest quantile_forest -v

Troubleshooting
---------------
If the build fails because SciPy is not installed, ensure OpenBLAS and LAPACK are available and accessible.

On macOS, run::

  brew install openblas
  brew install lapack
  export SYSTEM_VERSION_COMPAT=1

Then try rebuilding.
